        <p class="text">Netflix was founded in 1997 as a movie rental service that shipped DVDs to customers by mail.
          In 2007, Netflix started streaming movies and TV shows over the Internet. In 2001, Netflix had fewer than half a
          million subscribers. Today, it has more than 200 million paying members. </p>

        <p class="text">Netflix registered $24.996 billion in annual revenue in 2020, a 24% increase over the previous year.
          Since 2001, Netflix has recorded a compound annual revenue growth rate of 35.68%.</p>

        <p class="text">In 2020, Netflix reported revenue of over 11.45 billion U.S. dollars in North America,
          up from around ten billion in the previous year. The revenue generated in the United States and Canada
          was more than triple the amount brought in from Latin America, but revenue from the Asia Pacific region
          reached and surpassed two billion U.S. dollars for the first time in 2020.</p>

      <div class="text-container">
        <p class="text">In Q1 and Q2 of 2020, the Asia-Pacific region saw a 16 and 18 percent increase in revenue
          respectively thanks to a huge increase in subscriber figures (an increase of over 6 million in 6 months).
          Throughout the remainder of 2020 and into the start of 2021, this region continued to add the highest rate
          of subscribers with a further 5.4 million being added since Q2 2020.</p>

        <p class="text"> Netflixâ€™s recent announcement said that it had added over 25 million subscribers in the pandemic
          (15.77 million in Q1 and over 10 million in Q2), which is almost the same as the entire number added
          throughout 2019 - 28 million. Netflix currently has 203.66 million subscribers worldwide.
          The number of Netflix paying subscribers has grown by 21.9% in 2020.</p>

        <p class="text">While Netflix is available in almost every country in the world,
          the US is the most important one. Of the 200+ million Netflix subscribers, as of February 2021,
          the number of subscribers in the US and Canada is 73 million, in Europe, Middle East, and Africa
          66 million, Latin America 37 million and Asia-Pacific 25 million subscribers.</p>

        <p class="text">The number of movies available on Netflix was reduced throughout the years.
          There was a reduction of 3,000 films between 2010 and 2020, from 6,755 to 3,730. On the other hand,
          the number of TV shows has grown, from 530 to 2,108. As more media producers seek to hold subscriber
          attention for as long as possible, the smart investment is TV series. When people watch a movie, they
          watch Netflix for a couple hours. When they watch a TV show, they watch Netflix for days.</p>
